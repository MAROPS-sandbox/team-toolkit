Tools used for the processing and analysis of HYCOM and other lab projects

# What is this for?
- Hi all, this is just a bit of a playground for us to share and develop the various routines we use for HYCOM and our other spin-off projects. Here we can store and maintain working code that will be useful to others and enable us to work more efficently. Apologies if some of the code is matlab - I'm still busy with the python conversion!

# What should I do?
- As we are just starting this up, I would encourage everyone to play around as much as possible (make your own branches etc.), the only rule is do not store anything here that you do not have saved somewhere else (so that everyone can experiment without consequences). If you are not familiar with Git, I suggest doing one of the many online courses (I am busy with the codeacademy one)
